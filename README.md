# tns-s5-halloween
 
## What's needed:
* Bosses for the warped forest, crimson forest, lava ocean, and basalt deltas.
* Minions for the warped forest, crimson forest, lava ocean, and basalt deltas.
* Tiered loot chest loot tables.
* A marking system for mob spawning positions like the one for chests (See https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/tns-s5-halloween/tree/master/data/halloween-basics/functions/mark for implementation details).

## What's already there:
* Tier 1 loot table for chest (but could still use tweaking.)
* Chest marking system.
