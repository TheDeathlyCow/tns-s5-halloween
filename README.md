## What's needed:
* Bosses for the warped forest, crimson forest, lava ocean, and basalt deltas.
* Minions for the crimson forest, lava ocean, and basalt deltas.

## What's already there:
* Chest loot tables.
* Bedrock infused armour.
* Chest marking system.
* Warped Mansion mobs (vindicators, pillagers, endermites, witch, ravagers).
* Lava spirits, piglins.
* A framework for mob spawning markers.

### Important note:
ALL commands and loot tables should be created on https://mcstacker.net/ for consistent style (This is <i>VERY</i> important for NBT data especially). However, the enchant randomly function can be applied manually to loot tables.
