# tns-s5-halloween
Welcome to the GitHub page for the TNS season 5 datapack!

## Wiki
This GitHub has a wiki, available at https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/tns-s5-hallowen/wiki.

## Installation
This is a Minecraft Datapack for version 1.16.3. It is installed by placing the download of this file in .minecraft/saves/[YOUR WORLD NAME]/datapacks and then typing the command `/reload` or by simply opening the world. If you are in creative mode, you should see a message confirming it has been reloaded. I may include a proper guide on how to actually set up the datapack in the future, but for now I don't have the time. However, I will be publishing walkthroughs on the wiki for each dungeon as they come out on TNS, so watch out for those! 

## TNS Discord
This datapack was developed for a Halloween on the Minecraft server Totally Not Suspicious (TNS). If you for some reason haven't joined TNS yet (why haven't you if you're reading this??) you can do so with this link: https://discord.gg/kz6BXsP. 

### Important note:
ALL commands and loot tables should be created on https://mcstacker.net/ for consistent style (This is <i>VERY</i> important for NBT data especially). However, the enchant randomly function can be applied manually to loot tables.
